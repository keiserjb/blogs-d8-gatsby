In 2016, he again took first place at the MultiGP Drone Racing Championship (multigp.com), held at AMA Headquarters, in Muncie, Indiana. Soon thereafter, he won the 2016 World Drone Racing Championships in Hawaii (droneworlds.com), and then the Spaceport America Drone Summit in New Mexico (spaceportamericadronesummit.com). You might also catch a glimpse of him on television stations competing in FPV drone races across the country. Although he has quickly propelled to the top in the world of FPV drone racing, Shaun is humble, thankful for his success, and supports his wife’s FPV racing endeavors</p>\n\n<figure role=\"group\" class=\"align-center caption\"><div class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-narrow\">\n  \n      \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-visually_hidden\">\n    <div class=\"field__label visually-hidden\">Image</div>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">    <img srcset=\"/sites/default/files/styles/max_325x325/public/2020-10/shaun-nytfury-taylor-1.jpg?itok=fo_Yd0DO 325w, /sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/2020-10/shaun-nytfury-taylor-1.jpg?itok=ZluJLrnW 600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1290px) 325px, (min-width: 851px) 25vw, (min-width: 560px) 50vw, 100vw\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/max_325x325/public/2020-10/shaun-nytfury-taylor-1.jpg?itok=fo_Yd0DO\" alt=\"Shaun Taylor (center), on the podium after winning the inaugural MultiGP Championship.

That kind of hooked me there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>RH:</strong><em>How did you get started in it?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>ST:</strong> Me and my buddies followed the guys in France who were racing in the forest on YouTube. It’s all been self-taught. I watch online videos. I owe every bit of success to everybody [other competitors].</p>\n\n<p><strong>RH:</strong><em>How many hours or days a week do you devote to practicing?</em> <strong>ST:</strong>I practice every single day, two to eight hours a day. At one point I was using 100 battery packs a day. Now I limit myself to 40. I do one maneuver each day (Split S, Hairpin, etc.) and at the end of the week, I put everything together.</p>\n\n<figure role=\"group\" class=\"align-center caption\"><div class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-narrow\">\n  \n      \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-visually_hidden\">\n    <div class=\"field__label visually-hidden\">Image</div>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">    <img srcset=\"/sites/default/files/styles/max_325x325/public/2020-10/shaun-nytfury-taylor-2.jpg?itok=j4qMHEky 325w, /sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/2020-10/shaun-nytfury-taylor-2.jpg?itok=M2AgIPNh 600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1290px) 325px, (min-width: 851px) 25vw, (min-width: 560px) 50vw, 100vw\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/max_325x325/public/2020-10/shaun-nytfury-taylor-2.jpg?itok=j4qMHEky\" alt=\"To compete in the 2016 MultiGP National Championship, Shaun had to place first in the MultiGP Bakersfield Regional Qualifier.\" title=\"shaun-nytfury-taylor-2\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></div>\n          </div>\n\n  </div>\n<figcaption>To compete in the 2016 MultiGP National Championship, Shaun had to place first in the MultiGP Bakersfield Regional Qualifier.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>RH:</strong><em>Why do you love FPV racing?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>ST:</strong>The competition, the camaraderie, the fact that it’s not easy and takes a lot of work, and the technology aspect … tinkering. [I like] pushing myself to be better than I was yesterday.</p>\n\n<p><strong>RH:</strong> What was it like to compete in the Drone World Championship with your wife, Teng Ma?</p>\n\n<p><strong>ST:</strong>She was in the team race at the Drone Worlds. Her team from the U.K. took third. A lot of times, we’re in the same class. If she’s racing, it’s all about her. I could care less [about winning]. I want her to have fun. All my focus is on her</p>\n\n<figure role=\"group\" class=\"align-center caption\"><div class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-narrow\">\n  \n      \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-visually_hidden\">\n    <div class=\"field__label visually-hidden\">Image</div>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">    <img srcset=\"/sites/default/files/styles/max_325x325/public/2020-10/shaun-nytfury-taylor-3.jpg?itok=EDCIFkZ1 325w, /sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/2020-10/shaun-nytfury-taylor-3.jpg?itok=ocgIOnBY 600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1290px) 325px, (min-width: 851px) 25vw, (min-width: 560px) 50vw, 100vw\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/max_325x325/public/2020-10/shaun-nytfury-taylor-3.jpg?itok=EDCIFkZ1\" alt=\"Shaun shares his love of FPV racing with his wife of 10 years, Teng Ma.\" title=\"shaun-nytfury-taylor-3\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></div>\n          </div>\n\n  </div>\n<figcaption>Shaun shares his love of FPV racing with his wife of 10 years, Teng Ma.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>RH:</strong><em>How did you come up with the nickname Nytfury?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>ST:</strong>My wife said my drag racing car, a Toyota Supra, looked like the dragon (Night Fury) from How to Tame a Dragon. I stopped drag racing after I started FPV racing. I get more of a rush with FPV racing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>RH:</strong><em>What is your favorite multirotor right now?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>ST:</strong>I have no favorites. I flew an ARC 200 a lot in the past. Now I fly stretched X frames. I’m not sponsored by anybody. I design my own quadcopters.</p>\n\n<p><strong>RH:</strong><em>What are your other hobbies?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>ST:</strong>For most of my life, football. Now I’ve started teaching beginner, intermediate, and advanced classes on how to get an FAA 107 license through Drone U in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I’ve been asked to mold the bones for the course. You never know where drones will take you!</p>\n\n<p><strong>RH:</strong><em>Did you fly anything before you picked up quadcopters?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>ST:</strong>No, this is it. I was a full-time firefighter and used to drive a little RC car in the back of the fire station.</p>\n\n<figure role=\"group\" class=\"align-center caption\"><div class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-narrow\">\n  \n      \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-visually_hidden\">\n    <div class=\"field__label visually-hidden\">Image</div>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">    <img srcset=\"/sites/default/files/styles/max_325x325/public/2020-10/shaun-nytfury-taylor-4.jpg?itok=snHYTt26 325w, /sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/2020-10/shaun-nytfury-taylor-4.jpg?itok=2JxQ5LY1 600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1290px) 325px, (min-width: 851px) 25vw, (min-width: 560px) 50vw, 100vw\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/max_325x325/public/2020-10/shaun-nytfury-taylor-4.jpg?itok=snHYTt26\" alt=\"At the 2016 US National Drone Racing Championship, held at Governors Island NY, Shaun was a member of Team XDC, which took first place.\" title=\"shaun-nytfury-taylor-4\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></div>\n          </div>\n\n  </div>\n<figcaption>At the 2016 US National Drone Racing Championship, held at Governors Island NY, Shaun was a member of Team XDC, which took first place.</figcaption></figure><figure role=\"group\" class=\"align-center caption\"><div class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-narrow\">\n  \n      \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-visually_hidden\">\n    <div class=\"field__label visually-hidden\">Image</div>\n              <div class=\"field__item\">    <img srcset=\"/sites/default/files/styles/max_325x325/public/2020-10/shaun-nytfury-taylor-5.jpg?itok=4FErrT2i 325w, /sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/2020-10/shaun-nytfury-taylor-5.jpg?itok=UcbdWPv8 600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1290px) 325px, (min-width: 851px) 25vw, (min-width: 560px) 50vw, 100vw\" src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/max_325x325/public/2020-10/shaun-nytfury-taylor-5.jpg?itok=4FErrT2i\" alt=\"Shaun previously worked as a full-time firefighter.\" title=\"shaun-nytfury-taylor-5\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" /></div>\n          </div>\n\n  </div>\n<figcaption>Shaun previously worked as a full-time firefighter.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>RH:</strong> <em>What qualities do you think a good competitor needs to have?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>ST:</strong>You have to have work ethic—that’s the key.

It’s free. Remember that when you get out at the field, it’s real and there’s no reset button.</p>\n\n<p><strong>RH:</strong><em>What has life been like for you since winning the Drone World Championship in Hawaii and the Spaceport America Drone Summit?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>ST:</strong>No different. I have lots of friend requests on social media now. It’s just a race.
